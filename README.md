# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction <br/>

## About the Company <br/>
The Big Mart is an e-commerce and a supermarket chain, wants to improve the sales of the company by deploying a predictive model. 
The company collected sales data from the year 2013, for 1559 distinct products, and has 10 stores spread across different cities (Analytics Vidhya, 2016). <br/>

## Project Description <br/>

* The data is divided into two broad categories which are Product level and Outlet level properties. <br/>
* Based on these properties the predictive model would help the company determine the expected sales of each product at a particular store and would also help identify feature importance. <br/>
* Help the company determine properties of products as well as outlets that have a high or medium impact on the sales. <br/>

## Data Science Life-Cycle
* The biggest challenge was to analyze the given data to find and impute missing values and determine any ambiguous behavior present in the data. <br/>
* In-depth knowledge about different attributes of the data was obtained through Exploratory data analysis been performed both visually as well as statistically. <br/> 
* EDA proved to be beneficial in identifying missing and misspelled values, and Feature Engineering was used in transforming the categorical attributes into numerical attributes. <br/>
* After cleaning and transforming the data, training dataset was fitted and trained on various models such as Linear Regression, Decision tree, and Random Forest and the performance of the training set was analyzed through Cross-validation method. <br/>

## Validation of results
* RMSE (root mean square error) was deployed to determine the accuracy of the model. <br/>
