# Big-Mart-Sales-Prediction
The Big Mart is an e-commerce and a supermarket chain, wants to improve the sales of the company by deploying a predictive model. 
The company collected sales data from the year 2013, for 1559 distinct products, and has 10 stores spread across different cities (Analytics Vidhya, 2016). 
This data is divided into two broad categories which are Product level and Outlet level properties. 
Based on these properties the predictive model would help the company determine the expected sales of each product at a particular store and would also help identify feature importance. 
This would help the company determine properties of products as well as outlets that have a high or medium impact on the sales. 
The Data Science team at Big Mart has the responsibility of building a predictive model to estimate the sales of each product available at different stores. 
The biggest challenge for a team was to analyze the given data to find and impute missing values and determine any ambiguous behavior present in the data.  
Thus, to obtain in-depth knowledge about different attributes of the data, Exploratory data analysis was performed both visually as well as statistically. 
EDA proved to be beneficial in identifying missing and misspelled values, and Feature Engineering was used in transforming the categorical attributes into numerical attributes. 
After cleaning and transforming the data, training dataset was fitted and trained on various models such as Linear Regression, Decision tree, and Random Forest and the performance of the training set was analyzed through Cross-validation method. 
Moreover, the RMSE (root mean square error) was deployed to determine the accuracy of the model. 
The results are satisfactory; however, further modifications can be done in a dataset through feature engineering to improve the accuracy of the model.
